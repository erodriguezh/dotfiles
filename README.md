# EduÂ´s dotfiles

**Work in progress**

## Installation

Clone the repository (I like to keep it in the user folder hidden `~/.dotfiles`), then cd into it and execute the bootstrapper script.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/erodriguezh/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
  ```

If you would like to install it without Git.

  ```sh
  curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erodriguezh/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
  ```
